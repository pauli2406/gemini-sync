title: Load Testing
---

Use this guide to validate runtime behavior under multi-connector load.

## Example Test Mix

- 40 `sql_pull` connectors
- 40 `rest_pull` connectors
- 20 `rest_push` connectors

## Key Metrics

- Run success rate
- Freshness lag per connector
- Mean and p95 runtime duration
- Push pending queue depth

## Pass Criteria

- No sustained push backlog growth
- 99% or better success over test window
- Scheduled connector freshness within expected interval
- No checkpoint advancement on failed runs

## Suggested Procedure

1. Deploy test environment with representative connector distribution.
2. Execute a 24-hour synthetic workload.
3. Export run state + SLO metrics.
4. Enforce SLO gate and review failure traces.

## Supporting Commands

```bash
python scripts/generate_slo_report.py --database-url "$DATABASE_URL" --output slo-metrics.json
python scripts/check_slo_gate.py --metrics slo-metrics.json
```
