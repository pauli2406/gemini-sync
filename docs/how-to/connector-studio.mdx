Connector Studio provides guided authoring, validation, preview, and proposal workflows.

## Access

- List: `/studio/connectors`
- New connector wizard: `/studio/connectors/new`
- API endpoints: `/v1/studio/*`

## Required Configuration

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- `GITHUB_REPO` (connector-config repository)
- `GITHUB_BASE_BRANCH` (default `main`)
- Optional managed secrets: `MANAGED_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY`

## Create a Proposal

1. Open the new connector wizard.
2. Choose mode and source fields.
3. Validate and preview sample records.
4. Submit proposal.

Behavior:

- If GitHub credentials are configured, Studio opens a branch + PR in `GITHUB_REPO`.
- Without GitHub credentials, Studio returns a local proposal URL for offline workflows.

## Run-Now and Lifecycle

Studio supports create, edit, clone, pause, resume, delete, and run-now actions.
Pause/resume updates Helm schedule `enabled` state in generated proposal changes.
