title: Reconciliation, Upserts, and Deletes
---

Reconciliation compares current extracted records with prior state to derive deltas.

## Delete Policies

- `auto_delete_missing`: missing records produce deletes
- `soft_delete_only`: mark-only semantics for integrations that avoid hard deletes
- `never_delete`: upserts only

## Guidance

Use snapshot extraction when relying on `auto_delete_missing` to avoid false deletes.
