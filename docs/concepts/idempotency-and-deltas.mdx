title: Idempotency and Deltas
---

Push workflows require deterministic replay behavior.

## Idempotency

`POST /v1/connectors/{connector_id}/events` requires `Idempotency-Key`.

- Repeated key with identical payload is replay-safe.
- Repeated key with different payload is rejected with conflict.

## Delta Operations

Push events represent explicit deltas:

- `UPSERT`
- `DELETE`
