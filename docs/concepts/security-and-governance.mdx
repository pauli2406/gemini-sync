title: Security and Governance
---

IngestRelay enforces guardrails for docs, tests, security, and release quality.

## Required Security Checks

- Secret scan
- Dependency vulnerability audit
- Policy conformance validation
- Prompt-injection regression checks

## Required Quality Gates

- Schema validation
- TDD/EDD guardrails
- Docs drift + consistency
- OpenAPI drift gate
- Connector reference drift gate
- Scenario eval thresholds

## Secret Handling

- Connector `secretRef` resolves to `SECRET_<SECRETREF>` environment variables.
- Managed secret registry can be used from Studio for stored secret metadata.
