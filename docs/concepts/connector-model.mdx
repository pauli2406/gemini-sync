title: Connector Model
---

Connector files are declarative contracts validated by schema.

## Storage Model

- This runtime repo contains code plus curated examples.
- Environment-specific connectors should live in a connector-config repo.
- API/Ops/Studio discovery uses `CONNECTORS_DIR`.

## Contract Shape

A connector includes:

- Source extraction configuration
- Canonical mapping configuration
- Output destination
- Gemini target
- Reconciliation policy

## Modes

- `sql_pull`
- `rest_pull`
- `rest_push`
- `file_pull`

Each mode constrains valid source fields and operational behavior.
