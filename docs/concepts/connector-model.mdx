title: Connector Model
---

Connector files are declarative contracts validated by schema.

## Storage Model

- This runtime repo contains code plus curated examples.
- Environment-specific connectors should live in a dedicated connector-config repo.
- The API server, Ops UI, and Studio discover connectors from the directory set by `CONNECTORS_DIR`.

### `CONNECTORS_DIR`

The `CONNECTORS_DIR` environment variable tells the API server where to look for connector YAML files:

- Scans the top level of the configured directory only — subdirectories are not traversed.
- Accepts `.yaml` files at that level.
- Supports one directory (no colon-separated list).
- Default when unset: `connectors/` relative to the process working directory.
- **Only affects the `serve` command** (Ops UI + Studio). The `run` command always requires an explicit `--connector <path>` argument.

### `--connector` flag

The `gemini-sync-bridge run --connector <path>` flag accepts a path to a **single YAML file**. Both absolute paths and paths relative to the current working directory are supported. Passing a directory raises an error.

For a complete guide to setting up and using a connector-config repo, see [Connector Config Repository](/docs/how-to/connector-config-repo).

## Contract Shape

A connector includes:

- Source extraction configuration
- Canonical mapping configuration
- Output destination
- Gemini target
- Reconciliation policy

## Modes

- `sql_pull`
- `rest_pull`
- `rest_push`
- `file_pull`

Each mode constrains valid source fields and operational behavior.
