title: Data Envelope and NDJSON
---

All modes normalize records into a canonical document envelope before publish/ingest.

## Why Canonical Envelope

- Consistent downstream processing across sources
- Deterministic checksums for diffing
- Stable replay and auditability

## Artifacts

- `upserts.ndjson`
- `upserts.discovery.ndjson`
- `deletes.ndjson`
- `manifest.json`

Artifacts are written under connector/run paths in configured object storage.
