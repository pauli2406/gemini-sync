Reliability work focuses on deterministic replay, failure observability, and SLO enforcement.

## Core Outcomes

- Adapter test matrix coverage
- Replay tooling for run artifact verification
- SLO report and threshold gate integration

## Commands

```bash
python scripts/replay_run_artifacts.py --upserts file://./local-bucket/connectors/<id>/runs/<run_id>/upserts.ndjson --deletes file://./local-bucket/connectors/<id>/runs/<run_id>/deletes.ndjson
python scripts/generate_slo_report.py --database-url "$DATABASE_URL" --output slo-metrics.json
python scripts/check_slo_gate.py --metrics slo-metrics.json
