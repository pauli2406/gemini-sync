Choose the path that matches your goal.

## Operators

If you need a stable runtime and clear run visibility:

1. Run the local tutorial: [Local Getting Started](/docs/tutorials/getting-started-local).
2. Follow operations procedures: [Operate Runs](/docs/how-to/operate-runs).
3. Use incident recovery flow: [Troubleshooting](/docs/how-to/troubleshooting).

## Connector Authors

If you build or change connector definitions:

1. Start with [Connector Authoring](/docs/how-to/connector-authoring).
2. Pick a mode guide:
   - [SQL Pull](/docs/how-to/connectors/sql-pull)
   - [REST Pull](/docs/how-to/connectors/rest-pull)
   - [REST Push](/docs/how-to/connectors/rest-push)
   - [File Pull](/docs/how-to/connectors/file-pull)
3. Use UI-based workflows: [Connector Studio](/docs/how-to/connector-studio).

## Platform / Contributor Path

If you are changing runtime, CI, or docs:

1. Read [Architecture](/docs/concepts/architecture).
2. Read [Security and Governance](/docs/concepts/security-and-governance).
3. Run mandatory checks from [Testing and CI](/docs/contributing/testing-ci).
