## Gate Policy

Risk tier policy is defined in `.agent/risk_policy.yaml`.

For this repository baseline:

- Tier 0/1 can auto-merge after green gates.
- Tier 2 requires reviewer bot + one human reviewer.
- Tier 3 never auto-merges.

## Rollout

1. Merge only after all required gates pass.
2. Validate canary behavior and operational signals.
3. Keep rollback path as a single revert when possible.
