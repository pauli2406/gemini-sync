description: Ensures API/Ops/Studio honor CONNECTORS_DIR and preserve proposal file path contracts.
critical: false
pytest_selector: tests/test_connector_directory_support.py
acceptance:
  - API connector lookup resolves files from CONNECTORS_DIR.
  - Ops and Studio connector discovery use CONNECTORS_DIR when set.
  - Default discovery remains repo-local connectors when CONNECTORS_DIR is unset.
  - Studio proposals still target connectors/<connector-id>.yaml paths.
