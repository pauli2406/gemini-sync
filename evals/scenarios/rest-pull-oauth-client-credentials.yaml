description: Ensures rest_pull supports OAuth S2S token acquisition, refresh behavior, and invalid token payload handling.
critical: false
pytest_selector: tests/test_extractors_rest_pull_oauth.py
acceptance:
  - OAuth rest_pull acquires access token and calls source API with bearer auth.
  - Token refresh occurs proactively near expiry and on first 401 retry path.
  - Invalid OAuth token payload fails safely with clear extraction errors.
