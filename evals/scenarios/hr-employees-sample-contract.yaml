name: HR employees sample connector contract
description: Ensures the sample SQL connector keeps snapshot query and mapping contract fields.
pytest_selector: tests/test_connector_samples.py::test_hr_employees_sample_connector_sql_contract
expected_behavior:
  - Query remains snapshot-style (no :watermark filter) for full delete reconciliation.
  - Reconciliation policy stays auto_delete_missing.
  - Placeholder query is not committed.
  - ACL mapping and output prefix remain defined.
