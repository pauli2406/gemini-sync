description: Ensures the Oracle sample SQL connector keeps expected provider and reconciliation semantics.
pytest_selector: tests/test_connector_samples.py::test_oracle_employees_sample_connector_sql_contract
expected_behavior:
  - source.type remains oracle in the sample connector.
  - sample query is snapshot-style with no :watermark placeholder.
  - reconciliation policy stays auto_delete_missing.
